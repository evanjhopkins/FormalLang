Correctness:

- The program produces correct output.

- The program produces output in the correct format.


Style:

- Correct indentation

- Good block comments

- Missing header in the default constructor. Each function must have a
  comment block before it, which gives the function name, describes each
  parameter and the return value (if any), and explains the purpose of the
  function. Refer to the parameters by name, not by type. Here is an example:
/**
 * factorial
 *
 * This function computes the factorial of the given input. The factorial is
 * defined as factorial(n) = n! = n * (n-1) * (n-2) * ... * 3 * 2 * 1.
 * 
 * Parameters:
 *   n: the number on which to compute the factorial
 * 
 * Return value: the factorial of n, or 1 if n <= 0.
 */
public static int factorial(int n) {
  if (n <= 0) {
    return 1;
  }
  return n * factorial(n - 1);
}


Efficiency and Other Comments:

- Program is efficient as implemented.


CSV files:

- CSV files contain State-transition table and description of states.

- Next time, include a more meaningful description of the states. What does it
  mean to be in that state, for example.
